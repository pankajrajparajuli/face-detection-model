# face-detection-model
In this project, I developed a real-time face detection system using TensorFlow. The system is designed to detect and recognize faces in real-time through a webcam feed. By training a custom TensorFlow model, the project aims to provide an efficient and accurate solution for face detection tasks in various applications.
